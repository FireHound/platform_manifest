Firehound
=========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Firehound, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the CyanogenMod trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/FireHound/platform_manifest.git -b n

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

To Build:

    * . build/envsetup.sh && lunch fh_<device>-userdebug
    * make -j# (# = number of jobs)
